# Community RFCs for content on SimpleAsWater

RFCs to propose, discuss and collaborate on topics for [simpleaswater.com](https://simpleaswater.com)

With RFCs, we plan to democratize the learning components in the [simpleaswater.com](https://simpleaswater.com) website by enabling voting for all topics/tutorials.

We believe this can accelerate the learning momentum for everyone and provides a platform for you to curate the efforts put into this awesome site!

The process is pretty simple. Choose what you really want to do for the community:  

1. **Propose a new thread/topic/tutorial:** Do you believe that you can help the community by proposing a new topic that can benefit us all? Then propose a new RFC [here](https://github.com/simpleaswater/rfcs/issues/new/choose).  
  OR  
2. **Vote for a current proposal:** Do you see a proposal already made for your wishlist? In that case, we request you to upvote the RFC with a üëç reaction. You can also add a comment in respective RFCs for any suggestions or volunteering.  

RFCs are maintained by [@0zAND1z](https://github.com/0zAND1z)
