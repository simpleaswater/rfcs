# Community RFCs for content on SimpleAsWater

RFCs to propose, discuss and collaborate on topics for [simpleaswater.com](https://simpleaswater.com)

With RFCs, we plan to democratize the learning components in the [simpleaswater.com](https://simpleaswater.com) website by enabling voting for all topics/tutorials.

We believe this can accelerate the learning momentum for everyone and provides a platform for you to curate the efforts put into this awesome site!

The process is pretty simple. Choose what you really want to do for the community:  

1. Propose a new thread/topic/tutorial you believe can help the community  
  OR  
2. Vote for one of the current proposals with any suggestions or helping hand  

RFCs are maintained by [@0zAND1z](https://github.com/0zAND1z)
